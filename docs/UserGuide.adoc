== Introduction

Deliveria is a *desktop application* that allows a *delivery manager* to *manage and assign delivery tasks* efficiently.
While it consists of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI) that is user-friendly, Deliveria is *optimized for those who prefer* to work with a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) which allows fast management of the delivery tasks in an organisation.

=== Installing

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F14-4/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Deliveria.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

=== Scheduling Your First Task

Now you are in!
We have prepared a few sample customers and drivers for you to play around.

On a busy day, you might be having many orders coming in, and you want to get your drivers busy delivering them.
Let's go through the process of creating and assigning a task.

* Create a new task by typing `addT g/20 boxes of utensils c/1 dt/22/11/2019` in the command box.
You need to substitute `22/11/2019` with the date today.
Press Enter to execute the command.
* You can see the newly created task in the Incomplete Delivery Task box:


.The new task shows up in the Incomplete Tasks box
image::user-guide/adding-task.png[width=50%,scaledwidth=12cm,align="center"]

[NOTE]
Take note of the Task ID (i.e. #6), which is used to refer to this task.

* Execute command `suggest 2 t/6`, where
- `2` is the number of hours that you estimate this task will take to complete
- `6` is the ID of the task that you want to assign

* You can see Task #6 is assigned to Aloysius Chan at 2:00PM - 4:00PM

.The task is successfully scheduled
image::user-guide/suggest-task.png[width=70%,scaledwidth=12cm,align="center"]

[NOTE]
The suggested time slot will either start from now or in the future.

[NOTE]
We will optimize the driver and the time based on the drivers' availability and the task.
Learn more about the rule in <<Automatically scheduling a task: `suggest`>>

* If you are not satisfied with the suggestion, you can overwrite it by typing `assign force t/6 d/1 at/1500 - 1600`, where:
- `6` is the Task ID
- `1` is the Driver ID
- `1500 - 1600` is the time that you want to change to

[NOTE]
Learn more about the `assign` command in <<Manually assigning a task: `assign`>>

* We now have rescheduled the task to 3-4 pm.

.The task is rescheduled
image::user-guide/reschedule-task.png[width=70%,scaledwidth=12cm,align="center"]

[NOTE]
The drivers, by default, works from 9 AM to 9 PM. You cannot assign a time beyond the working hours.

You have created and scheduled your first task!
Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* If the last command does not change the state of the stored data e.g. `list`, then a previous command that changes
the data state will be undone instead.
* Example:
** User input sequence:
*** `addD n/Uncle Alex p/888889999 e/someone@gmail.com a/1 Pine Road tt/friends`
*** `list`
*** `undo`
** Result: `undo` will undo the `addD` command, as the `list` command does not change the data state.
