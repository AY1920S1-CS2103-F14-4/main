== PROJECT: Deliveria

---

== Introduction

This document serves as a project portfolio for Deliveria.
It summarises the contributes that I have made and the features I have implemented.

== Project Overview

Deliveria is a *desktop application* that allows a *delivery manager* to *manage and assign delivery tasks* efficiently.
While it consists of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI) that is user-friendly,
Deliveria is *optimized for those who prefer* to work with a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) which allows fast management of the delivery tasks in an organisation.

This is what Deliveria looks like:
