== PROJECT: Deliveria

---

== Overview

Deliveria is a *desktop application* that allows a *delivery manager* to *manage and assign delivery tasks* efficiently.
While it consists of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI) that is user-friendly,
Deliveria is *optimized for those who prefer* to work with a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) which allows fast management of the delivery tasks in an organisation.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view Customer and Driver details in separate window*
** What it does: Allows the user to view the full customer and driver details in a seperate window. The Customer
Window also has a map feature allowing the user to see the location of the Customer on a map.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the UI to display only the essential information of both the Driver and Customer.
This will result in a cleaner UI. It also allows the user to open multiple window simultaneously so that they are able to crossreference information
easily.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the Driver and Customer Cards in the UI. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to the existing command result and the additional map feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a Driver rating system and a notification window that shows incomplete tasks from previous days.
