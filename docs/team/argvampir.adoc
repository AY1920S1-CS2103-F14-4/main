== PROJECT: Deliveria

---

== Overview

Deliveria is a *desktop application* that allows a *delivery manager* to *manage and assign delivery tasks* efficiently.
While it consists of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI) that is user-friendly,
Deliveria is *optimized for those who prefer* to work with a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) which allows fast management of the delivery tasks in an organisation.

== About the project

My team of 5 software engineering students including myself were tasked to improve the existing command line
interface software, Addressbook application, as our Software Engineering team project. We were tasked to either
optimize the address book for a more specific target user group or morph it into a different product. Our team chose
to morph the product into a delivery task management system called Deliveria. The software allows inventory manager of
a delivery company to track the delivery tasks; manage the driver delivery work schedule; and able to generate a report
summary of the day without any access of internet.

This is what our project looks like:

My role specifically was to make all user interfaces of the program such as the layout, displaying list view, resizing
features, adding and navigating between tabs. Furthermore, I was in charge of the history and statistic component of the
software. The following sections illustrates the enhancement in a more detail manner, as well as the relevant
documentation I have added into the user and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

=== Enhancement added:

==== Statistic component:

** What it does: Displays to main bar charts of the customer and driver trends. The bar chart also automatically updates
depending on what the user inputted.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is solely a display that is not in a list
view type. The user can easily visualised the trend of the sales and comparing the orders between customers. Furthermore,
the graph for drivers allow the user to learn about the driver which may contribute to the driver rating system feature.
** Highlights: This part is rather challenging as I have never come across processing real-time data before. The feature
requires individual research upon bar charts and how to automatically update the bar charts in a real-time manner.

==== Completed Delivery List component:

** What it does: The `viewC` command allows the user to view completed tasks delivered to the specified customer ID.
The `viewD` command allows the user to view the completed tasks delivered by the specified driver ID. When typing `list`
it will refresh the completed list back to normal.
** Justification: The feature is significant to the product. The feature allows the user to keep track of the details
of what is delivered to the customer. From here, the user can learn about the customer loyalty and the customer taste or
simply how frequent he/she asked for deliveries.

==== History Command component:

** What it does: Automatically displays a list of all commands the user successfully entered.
** Justification: The feature offers the user to trace back what they have successfully inputted. For instance, he made
a variety of changes regarding the program today, he can trace back what he has done for the day and look into if he
had made any mistakes with the input.

==== UI component:
The UI component is basically the whole visualization of the program we had at the end. The layout, the window size,
the lists, the colour, the tabs, the send command box, was what I contributed and enhanced. The UI component also come
with the ability to drag between panes to allow greater display for a larger text. As well as shrinking the list to provide
space for a more important component. Furthermore, the component also has a `go` command feature allowing the fast typing
users to navigate between tabs without having to use their mouse to click.
